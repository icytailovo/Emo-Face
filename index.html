        <h3>Problem Setup:</h3>
        <p>There are times when people want to post their photos on social media without showing their real faces. 
            We want to provide a tool that automatically detects human faces and replaces them with other animals' 
            faces or emojis in a simple manner. This tool can protect people's privacy (by not showing their original faces) 
            and, at the same time, add some spice to the original photo. In detail, we will let the user upload an image that 
            contains people's faces. Then, the user will be prompted to write a short text description about the original image 
            with what kind of object to replace their original faces. Finally, the user can view and save newly generated images. </p>

        <h3>Data Used:</h3>
        <p> We use pre-trained data of OpenCV to detect faces and the pre-trained data of the DALL·E model to apply mask. </p>

        <h3>Algorithms / Techniques:</h3>
        <p>We use OpenCV for face detection and DALL•E for image editing based on the input prompt. After receiving the image 
            from our user, we first use OpenCV to detect the location of faces in the picture. Then, we change their alpha channel 
            to 0 and apply the DALL-E technique to the image. We feed the text that describes the resulting image given by the user 
            and the image generated to DALL-E to produce the masks on the image.

        <h3>How OpenCV works:</h3>
        <p>OpenCV uses a combination of 
            machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect faces in images. This includes the Haar Cascade Classifier, 
            a machine learning-based approach trained to detect features such as edges, lines, and corners in faces. Eigenfaces is 
            a technique used in facial recognition that is implemented in OpenCV. The basic idea behind Eigenfaces is to represent 
            each face as a linear combination of a small number of "eigenfaces," essentially the principal components of a set of 
            face images. Like the Eigenfaces technique, the Fisherfaces technique uses a different approach to extract the most 
            significant features. And the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) Cascade Classifier Algorithm is also a machine learning-based 
            approach that uses local binary patterns to detect faces. And the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) Cascade Classifier 
            captures information about the local gradient orientation of an image. Since the DALL·E model is trained on a large dataset of 
            text-image pairs, it learn to generate images that match a wide range of textual descriptions.
